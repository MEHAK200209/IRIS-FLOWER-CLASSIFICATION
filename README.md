# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. 
The size of dataset is too large, so I took it from Machine learning repository
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.
